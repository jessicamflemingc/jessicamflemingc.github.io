<!--the navigation bar content creation was inspired by w3schools.com https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp
I liked the look of the nav bar being across the top with different colours as you hover over it. So I used the example code as inspiration and then 
changed the colours to include LightSalmon for the main bar, tomato for the active page, and changed the font colouring and font family-->
<!-- photo gallery inspiration is from w3schools https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp. I changed the sizing of the photos to match 
the native resolution of the chosen images. I think added descriptions to the images and the layout of the gallery options -->
